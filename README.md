# ChatConsole
Simple console chat written in C#

My idea was to build sample client-server application to learn some basic networking in C#.

Set up:
1) Open Server -> bin -> Debug -> netcoreapp2.1 . In netcoreapp2.1 you will see Server.dll, 
in this folder open Windows PowerShell (Shift + Right click).

2) In PowerShell write dotnet ./Server.dll.

3) Open Client -> bin -> Debug -> netcoreapp2.1 . In netcoreapp2.1 you will see Client.dll.
In this folder open again Windows PowerShell (Shift + Right click).

4) In PowerShell write dotnet ./Client.dll.

5) Write your name and start chatting.

If you want to exit just write Exit.
